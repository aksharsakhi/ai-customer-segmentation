# AI-Driven Customer Segmentation and Marketing Campaigns

This repository contains an AI-driven solution for customer segmentation and personalized marketing campaigns for D2C businesses. The AI model clusters customers based on their behavior and suggests targeted marketing strategies.

## Features
- Customer segmentation using K-means clustering
- Predictive analytics for customer behavior using Random Forest
- Personalized marketing campaign generation
- Product recommendations based on customer segments

## Project Status
The AI model is still **under development and testing**. We are continuously refining it by training on larger datasets and improving segmentation accuracy.

## Files
- `customer_segmentation_marketing.py`: Python script for the AI model and marketing campaigns.
- `customer_data.csv`: Sample customer data for testing the model.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies needed to run the project.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aksharsakhi/ai-customer-segmentation.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
    ```bash
    cd ai-customer-segmentation
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Ensure that `customer_data.csv` is in the same directory as the Python script.
2. Run the Python script:
    ```bash
    python customer_segmentation_marketing.py
    ```

## Future Work
- Train the model with larger datasets to improve accuracy.
- Implement additional clustering methods for better segmentation.
- Add support for multi-channel marketing strategies.
